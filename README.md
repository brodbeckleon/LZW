# LZW Compressor

This repository contains Python scripts implementing the LZW compression algorithm, optimized for MicroPython environments like the TI-nspire calculator series. Both `.py` and `.tns` versions of the scripts are included.

## LzwCompressor.py and LZWCompressor.tns

`LzwCompressor.py` compresses text data using the LZW algorithm. The corresponding `.tns` file can be directly imported into TI-nspire calculators.

### Usage

Input your text data into `lz77_compress.py` or `.tns` to compress it.

### MicroPython Compatibility

Designed for MicroPython, suitable for devices like the TI-nspire calculator series.
